# Contributing

Thank you for helping grow Lets Talk CDC â€“ Change Feed Playground! This project is taking part in Hacktoberfest 2024, so we aim to make the contribution flow predictable and contributor-friendly.

## Before You Start
- Register for Hacktoberfest at [hacktoberfest.com](https://hacktoberfest.com/).
- Review open issues. Look for labels such as `good first issue`, `help wanted`, or `hacktoberfest`.
- If you want to propose a new idea, open an issue first so we can agree on scope.

## Local Setup
- Clone or fork the repository.
- Create a feature branch off `main`. Use descriptive names like `feature/my-enhancement`.
- No build step is required. Open `index.html` directly in your browser to test changes.

## Development Guidelines
- Keep contributions focused. Separate unrelated fixes into different pull requests.
- Prefer small, incremental commits with clear messages.
- Include comments only when necessary to explain non-obvious logic.
- Update documentation when you add or change functionality.

## Submitting Changes
1. Ensure your branch is up to date with `main`.
2. Commit your work following the branch naming convention above.
3. Push your branch to your fork (or the upstream repo if you have write access).
4. Open a pull request into `main` with a concise summary:
   - Describe the problem, your solution, and any side effects.
   - Reference related issues using `Fixes #123` when relevant.
   - Note any manual testing steps.
5. A maintainer will review, request adjustments if needed, and merge once approved.

## Hacktoberfest Expectations
- Quality over quantity. Spammy or low-effort pull requests will be marked as `invalid`.
- Stay respectful, follow the [Hacktoberfest Code of Conduct](https://hacktoberfest.com/participation/#codeofconduct), and keep discussions constructive.
- If you are unsure about anything, ask in the relevant issue or pull request before investing significant effort.

We appreciate your contributions and look forward to building something awesome together!
