# Loom Walkthrough Plan

We do not publish Loom walkthroughs anymore, but if we decide to refresh the internal recording this outline still works. Treat the bullets below as a reminder for our own reference.

- Record once lane diff overlays and guided tour scripting are stable.
- Script outline:
  1. Load baseline scenario (crud-basic) and show comparator filters/search.
  2. Highlight diff overlays + quick filters + telemetry buffer (`window.telemetry.buffer`).
  3. Demonstrate share/export with saved comparator snapshot.
  4. Close with harness report on `http://localhost:8089` to show PASS/FAIL loop.
- Archive the file locally (e.g. `/reports/loom/`) and link it in `docs/content-review-checklist.md` if we want to revisit later.

## Recording Status

- ✅ Recorded on 2025-03-22 using the `feature/step5-timeline-performance` build.
- ✅ Archived locally at `reports/loom/cdc-comparator-walkthrough.mp4`.
- ✅ Linked from `docs/content-review-checklist.md` for future launch reviews.
