# Loom Walkthrough Plan

- Audience: solutions engineers + product marketing.
- Record once lane diff overlays and guided tour scripting are stable.
- Script outline:
  1. Load baseline scenario (crud-basic) and show comparator filters/search.
  2. Highlight diff overlays + quick filters + telemetry buffer (`window.telemetry.buffer`).
  3. Demonstrate share/export with saved comparator snapshot.
  4. Close with harness report on `http://localhost:8089` to show PASS/FAIL loop.
- Upload to Loom workspace and link in `docs/content-review-checklist.md` when complete.
