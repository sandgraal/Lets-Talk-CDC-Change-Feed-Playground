# Issue: Operational sync on ownership, sprint board, and review cadence

## Summary
All operational chores are now consolidated under the core duo. We jointly own every workstream, so no external coordination, sprint board grooming, or demo scheduling remains.

## Motivation
Previous notes assumed handoffs to other teams and stakeholder demos. With the scope entirely in-house, we only needed to capture that the responsibility shift is intentional and no follow-up is required.

## Task Checklist
- [x] Confirmed that we (the two-person core team) own each P0 workstream and related documentation.
- [x] Dropped the separate sprint board maintenance since we track progress directly in code reviews and commits.
- [x] Removed the mid-sprint review/demo requirement—there are no audiences beyond us.
- [x] Skipped cross-functional prep; no partners or invites needed.
- [x] Updated project docs to reflect the self-contained ownership model.

## Testing Notes
- Documentation-only change; verify Markdown renders without broken links.
