# Issue: Operational sync on ownership, sprint board, and review cadence

## Summary
Close the open operational chores by confirming workstream ownership, updating the sprint board, and scheduling the mid-sprint review demo.

## Motivation
Project tracking still lists these items as pending (ðŸ”„). Resolving them keeps stakeholders aligned and ensures upcoming demos and launches have coverage.

## Task Checklist
- [ ] Confirm or assign owners for each P0 workstream and document them in the tracker (`docs/next-steps.md`).
- [ ] Audit the sprint board, reflect shipped feature flags, and move completed stories to Done.
- [ ] Schedule the mid-sprint review meeting with agenda covering Event Log, Pause/Resume, Query warnings, and trigger follow-up.
- [ ] Share meeting invite + prep materials (demo script, checkpoints) with cross-functional partners.
- [ ] Update documentation or status notes with confirmed ownership and meeting details.

## Testing Notes
- No code changes expected; verify documentation updates render correctly and links remain valid.
