# Content Review Checklist

Run this checklist before publishing walkthroughs, docs, or in-product callouts:

- [ ] Comparator copy matches `docs/telemetry-taxonomy.md` event names and lane terminology.
- [ ] “When to use which” text aligns with `assets/method-copy.js`.
- [ ] Screenshots were captured after running `npm run build:web` to ensure styling parity.
- [ ] Scenario matrix in `README.md` still reflects curated templates.
- [ ] Loom walkthrough (see `docs/enablement/loom-plan.md`) reviewed by product + solutions.
- [ ] External docs reference the same feature flag names as `docs/next-steps.md` Launch Readiness section.
