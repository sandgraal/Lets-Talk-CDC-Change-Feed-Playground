# Implementation Next Steps

> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Release sync:** The shipped scope for v1 is tracked in [`docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md`](./IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md#current-release-scope-v1-0-0). Update both documents together when statuses change.

## Sprint Kickoff Focus (P0)
- Stand up the new `/src` module layout (engine, modes, domain, ui, features, test) and add minimal scaffolding exports. ‚úÖ
- Implement the core `EventBus`, `CDCController` state machine skeleton, and shared `MetricsStore` interfaces. ‚úÖ
- Close the CRUD reliability gaps: controlled form inputs, single-write semantics, and surfaced error toasts. ‚úÖ (gated by feature flag `ff_crud_fix`).
- Build the Event Log panel with filters/actions and wire the real-time produced/consumed counters. ‚úÖ (gated via `ff_event_log`).
- Add Pause/Resume for the consumer, backlog + lag metrics, and the Event Bus column visualizing queued offsets. ‚úÖ (`ff_event_bus`, `ff_pause_resume`).
- Ship the Query mode polling interval slider, lossy-delete banner, and `missedDeletes` metric. ‚úÖ (`ff_query_slider`).

## Enablers & Platform Work
- Add feature flags for P0 scope (`ff_event_bus`, `ff_pause_resume`, `ff_query_slider`, `ff_crud_fix`, `ff_event_log`). ‚úÖ incorporated in `index.html`.
- Refresh unit/e2e test suites to cover EventBus ordering, CRUD flows, pause/resume backlog, and query-mode lossiness. ‚úÖ Unit coverage now exists for `CDCController`, adapters, metrics widgets, and lane diff schema drift; Playwright exercises the schema walkthrough end-to-end.
- Update developer docs (onboarding, harness guide) with the new architecture map and event bus workflow. ‚úÖ Added event-flow overview and harness mapping notes.
- Prepare initial metrics telemetry hooks (in-memory only) and dashboard UI shell. ‚úÖ Dashboard surfaces per-lane metrics with schema walkthrough controls in place.
- Harden the high-volume generator + replay tooling. ‚úÖ Extracted generator runtime into a tested shared module powering the comparator burst controls and verified workspace replay wiring.

## Definition of Ready
- Implementation plan captured at `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and linked in team tooling. ‚úÖ
- Owners identified for each P0 workstream; story tickets created with acceptance criteria above. üîÑ Confirm assignment. See [docs/issues/ops-sync.md](./issues/ops-sync.md).
- UI copy agreed for warning/info badges and pause help text; visual mocks shared with design partners. ‚úÖ
- Test data scenarios scripted (rapid updates, delete between polls) and automated where feasible. ‚úÖ (scenarios in `src/features/scenarios.ts`).

## Tracking
- Capture progress in the sprint board using the P0 feature flags as epics. üîÑ Update board to reflect shipped flags. Tracked in [docs/issues/ops-sync.md](./issues/ops-sync.md).
- Schedule mid-sprint review to demo Event Log, Pause/Resume, and Query mode warning behaviors. üîÑ Included in [docs/issues/ops-sync.md](./issues/ops-sync.md).

## Near-Term Priorities (handoff)
- Flesh out mode adapters with richer telemetry (write amplification, missed deletes) reflected in UI summaries. ‚úÖ Lane checks panel now surfaces diff + lag chips; schema drift chips land in summary.
- ‚úÖ Replace placeholder `src/ui/components/EventLog` with the actual component now that the comparator pulls data from `/src` runtimes.
- Add unit tests around `CDCController`, `EventBus`, and each mode adapter (see `src/test/README.md`). ‚úÖ Vitest suite now covers adapters, controller, metrics, and lane overlays; continue expanding toward multi-table scenarios.
- ‚úÖ Add Storybook visual regression notes for lane checks / diff overlay so QA knows which Ladle stories to reference. See `docs/enablement/lane-diff-visual-regression.md` for the canonical story list and screenshot guidance.
- ‚úÖ Multi-table + transactional demo landed with apply-on-commit toggle; follow-up e2e for transaction drift still on backlog. See [docs/issues/transaction-drift-e2e.md](./issues/transaction-drift-e2e.md).

## Outstanding backlog
- [ ] Appwrite persistence + configuration ([docs/issues/appwrite-persistence.md](./issues/appwrite-persistence.md))
- [ ] Trigger write amplification surfaced in UI/walkthrough ([docs/issues/trigger-write-amplification.md](./issues/trigger-write-amplification.md))
- [ ] Operational sync on owners + mid-sprint review ([docs/issues/ops-sync.md](./issues/ops-sync.md))
- [ ] `comparator_v2` staged rollout readiness ([docs/issues/comparator-v2-rollout.md](./issues/comparator-v2-rollout.md))
- [ ] Feature flag activation governance ([docs/issues/feature-flag-governance.md](./issues/feature-flag-governance.md))
- [ ] Persistent scenarios & shareable experiences ([docs/issues/shareable-experiences.md](./issues/shareable-experiences.md))
