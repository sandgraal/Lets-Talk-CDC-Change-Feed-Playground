# Feature Flag Matrix

This matrix tracks the major feature flags used in the CDC playground, summarising ownership, intent, defaults, and rollout sequencing so we can coordinate our own launches without involving other teams. Outstanding governance work is tracked in [docs/issues/feature-flag-governance.md](./issues/feature-flag-governance.md).

| `ff_crud_fix`     | Core duo | Hardens CRUD flows with controlled inputs, single-write semantics, and surfaced error toasts. | Enabled by default in `index.html`.                                           | Ships as part of the P0 feature bundle alongside Event Log, Event Bus, Pause/Resume, and Query slider workstreams.                                 |
| `ff_event_log`    | Core duo | Unlocks the Event Log panel with filters/actions and produced/consumed counters.              | Enabled by default in `index.html`.                                           | Ships in the P0 bundle; remains on once the Event Log meets acceptance criteria.                                                                   |
| `ff_event_bus`    | Core duo | Shows the Event Bus column with backlog and lag metrics sourced from the shared EventBus.     | Enabled by default in `index.html`.                                           | Ships in the P0 bundle to support pause/resume and backlog instrumentation.                                                                        |
| `ff_pause_resume` | Core duo | Enables pause/resume controls so users can observe backlog growth and draining behaviour.     | Enabled by default in `index.html`.                                           | Ships in the P0 bundle together with Event Bus visibility.                                                                                         |
| `ff_query_slider` | Core duo | Provides the polling interval slider and query-mode lossiness messaging.                      | Enabled by default in `index.html`.                                           | Ships in the P0 bundle to highlight query-mode trade-offs.                                                                                         |
| `ff_trigger_mode` | Core duo | Adds the trigger-based CDC adapter with write-amplification modelling.                        | **⚠️ Not in index.html** - Implementation exists but flag not exposed yet.    | Enable after completing trigger write amplification UI work; tracked in [trigger-write-amplification.md](./issues/trigger-write-amplification.md). |
| `ff_schema_demo`  | Core duo | Drives the schema change demo with add/drop column flows and schema version badges.           | **✅ Enabled** in `index.html` - comparator walkthrough + tests stay in sync. | Remains on now that the scenario smoke is covered; toggle only when debugging schema issues.                                                       |
| `ff_multitable`   | Core duo | Exposes multi-table + transactional scenarios with apply-on-commit coordination.              | **✅ Enabled** in `index.html` - transaction coverage + tutorials stay green. | Keep enabled for day-to-day demos; only disable locally when isolating non-transaction bugs.                                                       |
| `ff_metrics`      | Core duo | Surfaces the metrics dashboard with backlog, lag percentiles, and lane checks telemetry.      | **✅ Enabled** in `index.html` - comparator smoke and tests passing.          | Metrics dashboard functional; continue monitoring telemetry performance.                                                                           |
| `ff_walkthrough`  | Core duo | Enables the guided tooltips and glossary walkthrough experience.                              | **⚠️ Not in index.html** - Copy + tour ordering need final review.            | Add to index.html after content review and walkthrough flow validation; see [feature-flag-governance.md](./issues/feature-flag-governance.md).     |

## Runtime sources and guardrails

- **Manifest:** `assets/feature-flag-manifest.json` is the single source of truth for flag purpose, rollout readiness, and whether each flag should ship in `index.html` by default.
- **Load order:** `assets/feature-flags.js` seeds flags from (1) `APPWRITE_CFG.featureFlags`, (2) `window.CDC_FEATURE_FLAGS`, (3) `localStorage` (`cdc_feature_flags_v1`), and (4) query params (`flag` or `flags=,` lists). Once any source is provided it acts as an allowlist.
- **Drift check:** `npm run lint:flags` asserts `index.html` defaults match the manifest and that no unknown flags are present. Run it locally before PRs; CI runs it via `ci:preflight`.
